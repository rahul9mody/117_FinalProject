# 117_FinalProject
Final project for 117, Spring 2018 semester

The main idea behind the project is demonstrate html, CSS and bootstrap skills learned throughout the semester.
To do this, the project is divided into 3 main pages:

1. A home page that is structured to display a row of cards, a carousel and a form. 
   Everything fit together under a container.
   There is a jumbotron and a navbar on top. This element is also common on all of the rest of the pages.
2. A blog pages. It has a main title on it.
   Its display 2 rows of cards that each contain an image, title and text along with a button to load a new page. 
   The first row has two cards, while the seconf has three. This is to show the adaptability of bootstrap.
   When the site it opened up in a mobile phone. All the cards fall into a vertical view of the same width.
   
   Apart from that, its button on the supposed blog display a spearate page upon click.
   
3. A third page is an attempt to create a layout, the same as twitter.
   It manages to copy its layout, style, CSS elements as well as the user profile section.
   Its used a mixture of common CSS and infile CSS to varying degree of success.
   
There is an umbrella page that is not part of the particular site, but provides access to it along with all the sister projects I did.
